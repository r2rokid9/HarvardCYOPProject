<h1>Credit Card Fraud Detection</h1>
<br>
Analyzing the Effectiveness of Data Set Balancing Techniques in Classifications for Detecting Truly Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions<br>
<br>
<b>Objective</b>: Maximize the True Negatives obtained (truly fraudulent credit card transactions) from the model and analyzing the effect of data balancing techniques to the resulting models.</br>
<br>
<b>Data set used:</b> ULB Dataset from Kaggle
<br>
<h2> Contents </h2>
<br>
The following files are the contents of the project<br>
<br>
<b>CreditCardFraudReport.pdf</b> = PDF file containing the report<br>
<br>
<b>CreditCardFraudReport.rmd</b> = R Markdown file used to produce CreditCardFraudReport.pdf<br>
<br>
<b>CreditCardFraudAnalysis.r</b> = R script consistent to the report and markdown file<br>

<h2> Running the .rmd or .r code </h2>

To run the code, the dataset "creditcard.csv" is needed. To speed up the process, it is recommended to download the .csv file and place it on the same directory as the .rmd file.<br> You may download the dataset from the URL here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11I9uOAEegAWi7Wi-ch_cZud1I_Ac4yzQ/view?usp=sharing<br>
